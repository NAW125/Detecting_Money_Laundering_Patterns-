    "Following the exploratory data analysis and visualisations developed in Tableau, this section will  apply a supervised machine learning approach to predict the likelihood that a financial transaction is fraudulent. The model is trained on the pre-processed, labeled dataset, prepared in the `etl_process.ipynb` notebook. By using classification techniques, the goal is to identify key patterns and risk indicators that may signal potential money laundering or financial crime activity before the transaction occurs.\n",
