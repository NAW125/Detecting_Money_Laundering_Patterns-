##  1. Overview
1.1 Problem Statement

Money laundering is a significant and growing global issue that directly funds organized crime and terrorism. While the true scale of money laundering is difficult to quantify, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) estimates that between 2% and 5% of global GDP is laundered each yearâ€”equivalent to EUR 715 billion to 1.87 trillion annually.

To combat this, banks and financial institutions worldwide are subject to regulations at both national and international levels. The responsibility to detect and report money laundering activities falls on corporate institutions globally, although the effectiveness of these efforts varies.

When institutions fail to comply with anti-money laundering (AML) regulations, the consequences can be severe. In June 2025, for example, the Monetary Authority of Singapore issued a record fine of $1.6 billion in a high-profile laundering case that damaged the city's financial reputation.

Beyond financial penalties, money laundering poses a direct threat to the profitability and reputation of institutions and contributes to long-term societal harm by enabling criminal networks that destabilize communities worldwide.

In the United Kingdom, the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 requires financial institutions to implement risk-based customer due diligence approach and take proactive measures to prevent their services from being used for money laundering or terrorist financing.
This project investigates synthetic financial transaction data to identify patterns indicative of money laundering, drawing on datasets that span multiple countries, industries, and transaction types.

## 2. Dataset 
This project explores synthetic financial transaction data, modelled on real data to detect patterns consistent with money laundering activity. Using data spanning multiple countries across the world, industries, and transaction types, we apply statistical methods, risk scoring, and machine learning models to identify patterns of behavior associated with money laundering. 
The objective is to identify anti-money laundering (AML) insights and recommendations by highlighting suspicious transaction profiles with a view to informing and improving financial compliance workflows.
All data used has been generated for research purposes mimicking  the complexity and structure of real-world financial transactions.
